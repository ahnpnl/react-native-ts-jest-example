# An example repo to run `ts-jest` with React Native

## Important notes:
- To run `ts-jest` with React Native, you have to use together with `Babel`. `Babel` will take care of `jsx` while `ts-jest`
takes care of `tsx` (see `jest.config.js`).
- `Tsconfig` for `jsx` has to set to `react` instead of `react-native` (see jest.config.js).
